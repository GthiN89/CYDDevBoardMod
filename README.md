# CYDDevBoardMod
Just device i did build to myself to test various CYD firmwares or wiring in my projects without constant need to soldering.
 Repository contains lazy 3d model of CYD enclosure with integrated breadboard. To the breadboard, i wired all avaliable GPIOS, SDcard SPI pins, and those i made avaliable by desoldering RGB diod and sacrifice of sound output. for those lines that are wired to the board i used metal sheets i canibalized from the regular breadboard, and the rest of the breadboard use just aluminimum foil.
I found this device really useful.
